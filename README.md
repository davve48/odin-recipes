This project aims to be my first deep dive in full stack developing. It aims to create a fully funcional recipe website where recipes can be easily added and found.

A collection designed to ease the everyday. 

Just add your own recipes and upload it onto a home server,  now enjoy cooking without having to google your favorite recipes over and over again because now you can find the easier than ever. 

This project was done using swedish as display language. If you seek to replicate the code in another langugage make sure to correct the language in the html header to your preffered language.
